CAS (Applied Data Science) 2021

With the explosion of data in science, economics, administration, medicine and many other fields, the importance and the demand for data science skills are increasing. It is the scientific methods and processes of extracting knowledge and insights from data. In light of this, the University of Bern offers a Certificate of Advanced Studies (CAS) program in Applied Data Science.

It is structured in six modules with modern teaching methods that are peer oriented. The program is applied in the sense of focusing on concepts and usage of common data science infrastructures and software tools, not on theoretical elaboration of the mathematics, statistics and informatics.
