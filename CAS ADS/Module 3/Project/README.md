In this project, NPVM Data (Nationales Personenverkehrsmodell) has been studied. Following questions have been addressed: <br>
   1. To what extent is the number of employees in a zone related to other variables in that zone? <br>
   2. What is the number of travel cards in a zone? (predicting number of subscriptions) <br> 
   
Predictive algorithms such as linear regression and Random forest were used, along with other methods like Cross validation and Feature importance analysis <br>
A simple fully connected neural network was also build for the same task <br>
Clustering on different zones according to job densities in that zone <br>
Convolutional Neural network on images based on spatial distribution of a zone to predict number of subscriptions
